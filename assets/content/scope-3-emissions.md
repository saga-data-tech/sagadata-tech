# The Data Challenges of Scope 3 Emissions

As companies race to meet net-zero targets, Scope 3 emissions—those produced by the supply chain—remain the biggest hurdle.

## The Invisible Problem

Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (energy) emissions are relatively easy to measure. Scope 3 often accounts for over 70% of a company's carbon footprint but is notoriously difficult to track.

### Key Data Hurdles

1.  **Vendor Fragmentation**: Data is scattered across thousands of suppliers.
2.  **Inconsistent Formats**: Every supplier uses different metrics and reporting standards.
3.  **Lack of Transparency**: Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers are often completely opaque.

## The Solution: Data Integration

To solve this, organizations need a robust data strategy that integrates external supplier data with internal procurement systems.

*   Automated data ingestion pipelines.
*   Standardized carbon accounting models.
*   AI-driven gap filling for missing data.

Saga Data helps companies build the infrastructure to measure, report, and reduce Scope 3 emissions effectively.
