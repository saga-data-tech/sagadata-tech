# Getting Started with RAG

Generative AI is transforming business, but Large Language Models (LLMs) have a flaw: they don't know your private data. This is where Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) comes in.

## What is RAG?

RAG is a technique that enhances LLM accuracy by fetching relevant data from your internal knowledge base before generating a response.

### How it Works
1.  **Ingestion**: Documents are split into chunks and converted into vector embeddings.
2.  **Retrieval**: When a user asks a question, the system finds the most relevant chunks.
3.  **Generation**: The LLM uses these chunks as context to answer the question accurately.

## Why it Matters

*   **Accuracy**: Reduces hallucinations by grounding answers in facts.
*   **Security**: Keeps your data private while leveraging powerful models.
*   **Freshness**: No need to retrain models when data changes.
