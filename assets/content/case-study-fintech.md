# Scaling from Spreadsheet to Database

## The Challenge

A rapidly growing fintech startup was managing critical financial reporting using a complex web of Excel spreadsheets. As transaction volumes exploded, this manual process became a major risk. Reports were delayed, errors were frequent, and the finance team was overwhelmed.

## The Solution

Saga Data implemented a modern data stack:
*   **Centralized Data Warehouse**: Snowflake was chosen for its scalability.
*   **Automated Pipelines**: Fivetran replaced manual CSV exports.
*   **BI Dashboards**: Power BI provided real-time visibility into cash flow.

## The Results

> "Saga Data didn't just build a database; they gave us our weekends back." — CFO

*   **90% Reduction** in reporting time (from 2 days to 2 hours).
*   **Zero** manual data entry errors.
*   **Real-time** insights for executive decision-making.
