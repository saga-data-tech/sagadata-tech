# Predictive Maintenance Saves Millions

## The Challenge

A global manufacturing firm was facing millions in losses due to unplanned downtime. Critical machinery would fail unexpectedly, halting production lines and delaying shipments.

## The Solution

We deployed an end-to-end IoT and ML solution:
1.  **Sensor Integration**: Connected legacy machines to the cloud.
2.  **Anomaly Detection**: Trained ML models on historical vibration and temperature data.
3.  **Alerting System**: Integrated with the maintenance team's mobile devices.

## The Results

*   **85% Accuracy** in predicting failure 48 hours in advance.
*   **$2.5M** saved in avoided downtime in the first year.
*   **Extended equipment lifespan** by optimizing maintenance schedules.
