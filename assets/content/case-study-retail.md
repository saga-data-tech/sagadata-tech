# Customer 360 View Driving Sales

## The Challenge

A major retail chain struggled to understand its customers. Online data was in one silo, in-store POS data in another, and loyalty program data in a third. They couldn't tell if an Instagram ad viewer was the same person buying in-store.

## The Solution

Saga Data built a Customer 360 platform using the "Cool & Industrial" stack:
*   **Identity Resolution**: Unified customer profiles across all touchpoints.
*   **Segmentation**: Created dynamic segments based on behavior and value.
*   **Activation**: Synced segments to marketing platforms for personalized campaigns.

## The Results

*   **25% Increase** in Customer Lifetime Value (LTV).
*   **30% Improvement** in ad ROAS (Return on Ad Spend).
*   **Unified view** of the customer journey from click to brick.
