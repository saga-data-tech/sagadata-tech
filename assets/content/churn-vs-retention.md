# Churn vs. Retention: Where to Focus?

In the subscription economy, growth is vanity, but retention is sanity. While acquiring new customers is exciting, keeping them is what builds a unicorn.

## The Economics of Retention

It costs 5-25x more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one. improving retention by just 5% can increase profits by 25-95%.

### Metrics that Matter

*   **Churn Rate**: The percentage of subscribers who leave in a given period.
*   **Net Revenue Retention (NRR)**: Revenue retained from existing customers, including upgrades.
*   **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**: Total revenue expected from a single customer.

## Strategies for Improvement

1.  **Predictive Analytics**: Identify at-risk customers before they leave.
2.  **Personalized Engagement**: Send the right message at the right time.
3.  **Value Realization**: Ensure customers are actually using the product features they pay for.

Focusing on retention isn't just about saving money—it's about building a sustainable, high-growth business.
